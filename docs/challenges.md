# Challenges

1. **Undocumented API**: Lack of official documentation required extensive testing to understand the API's behavior.
2. **Rate Limiting**: The API imposed rate limits, necessitating careful management of request frequency.
3. **Data Volume**: The potential large number of names required an efficient strategy to minimize API calls.
4. **Error Handling**: Network errors and API inconsistencies required robust error handling mechanisms.
